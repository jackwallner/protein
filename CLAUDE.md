# Protein Tracker — Project Guide

Pure protein tracking: one gram target, one number, wrist-first. XcodeGen
project/scheme: `Protein`, sim lease owner `protein` (`protein-watch` for a
paired-watch lease).

## Tech Stack
- Swift 6 / SwiftUI (strict concurrency)
- HealthKit (`dietaryProtein`, read **and** write), SwiftData in an App Group,
  WidgetKit, WatchConnectivity
- XcodeGen (`project.yml`). Targets: iOS 17+, watchOS 10+
- RevenueCat, entitlement lookup key `Protein+` (same string as the branding)

## Targets / bundle IDs
- `Protein` — `com.jackwallner.protein`
- `ProteinWidget` — `com.jackwallner.protein.widget`
- `ProteinWatch` — `com.jackwallner.protein.watch`
- `ProteinWatchWidget` — `com.jackwallner.protein.watch.widget`
- `ProteinTests` — `com.jackwallner.protein.tests`
- App Group `group.com.jackwallner.protein`
- ASC record `6797089333`

## Architecture

**HealthKit is the single source of truth, including for our own entries.**
This is the one decision the rest of the app hangs off (`docs/plan.md` §4):

```
log 30g on wrist  →  HKQuantitySample(.dietaryProtein, 30g, source = us)
today's total     =  sum of ALL dietaryProtein samples
                     WHERE source ∈ (us + user-selected external sources)
SwiftData         =  read-through cache, for the widgets/complication only
```

Consequences, all deliberate:
- **No WatchConnectivity queue for entries.** HealthKit syncs across the paired
  devices, so a wrist tap reaches the phone with no write ordering, no retry,
  and no "logged while the phone was asleep" case. WC carries *settings only*
  (target, presets, entitlement, excluded sources), phone → watch, via
  `applicationContext`. Exclusions belong on that list: HealthKit hands both
  devices the same samples, so a wrist that has not been told a source was
  switched off keeps summing it and disagrees with the phone all day.
- **Double counting is not a special case.** One sum over one source set.
- **Write auth can be denied**, and HealthKit says so honestly. `ProteinLogService`
  falls back to `LocalProteinEntry` rows, which are summed alongside the
  HealthKit samples and migrated in later by `retryPendingLocalEntries()`. This
  path ships in v1; do not let it rot. **Both devices run it**: the watch has its
  own App Group, so grams stranded there can only be rescued by the watch itself.
- Reads use an `HKSampleQuery` grouped by source, **not** a statistics
  collection — the Sources screen needs per-source grams *and* timestamps, and
  a statistics sum cannot answer "which app, and when".

`ProteinReconciliation` is pure (no HealthKit, no SwiftUI) and carries the
multi-source rules. It is the only part verifiable without a real device and
two food loggers, so it is the part that is unit tested hard.

Key files:
- `Shared/Utilities/ProteinReconciliation.swift` — totals, per-source rows, duplicate risk
- `Shared/Services/HealthKitService.swift` — read/write/auth/observer/cache
- `Shared/Services/ProteinLogService.swift` — log, undo, write-denied fallback
- `Shared/Services/WatchSyncService.swift` — settings mirror, phone → watch
- `Shared/Utilities/ProteinTargets.swift` — the audience fork's target maths
- `Shared/Utilities/ProteinInsights.swift` — streaks, days on target, month-on-month
- `Shared/Services/TargetHistoryService.swift` — what a target change does to past days

## Free vs Protein+

**Logging is free, everywhere** (decided 2026-08-10). Adding grams on the phone
and on the wrist, the three quick-add buttons, and any amount you like: all
free, along with the target, today's total imported from Apple Health, source
controls, the widget, the complication, and 7 days of history. An app whose
whole job is "tap a number" cannot charge before the first tap.

Protein+ is what a month of that adds up to: **every day you have logged**
(changed 2026-08-12 from a 30-day cap), streaks and month-on-month trends (the
Protein+ tab), setting the three quick-add buttons to your own amounts, and the
evening reminder. `PlusFeature` in `PaywallView.swift` is the single source of
truth for the list; every pitch surface reads it.

History is unbounded because HealthKit already stores it: `fetchFullHistory()`
queries ten years and trims the leading empty days, so the range starts when the
user did. The History screen offers 7 / 30 / 90 / All, and past 90 loaded days
the chart switches to a bar per week (`ProteinInsightsBuilder.weeks`) with
*averages*, because a weekly sum against a daily target line compares two
different units. The Protein+ tab still compares this month with the last one;
only Best streak reads the whole history.

The three quick-add buttons ship at 25/30/40 g and work for everyone. A lapsed
subscriber keeps whatever amounts they set — locking the editor is the gate, and
reverting their buttons would be a punishment for cancelling.

The complication keeps updating for free users on purpose. It costs nothing and
it is what keeps the app on the wrist while they reconsider; the graveyard
clones in `aso-plan.md` collect one-star reviews for taking everything away.

**Tabs are Today, History, Protein+, Settings.** The Protein+ tab is an embedded
paywall for free users (`impressionID: "protein_plus_tab"`) and the subscriber
hub otherwise, the same shape as VO2+ and Vitals+. Off-screen it renders
`Color.clear` so a paywall nobody opened logs no impression and puts nothing in
front of VoiceOver.

**Changing the target asks about the past.** History rows print the target that
was in force on the day, but a day the app never reconciled has no row and falls
back to the current target — so doing nothing is not neutral, and raising the
target silently turns a week of green days red. `TargetHistoryService` makes
both answers a write.

It stores a **change log** ("from this day forward, the target was N") in the
App Group defaults, not a row per day. Keeping the past appends one entry;
applying it collapses the log to a single all-time entry and rewrites the stored
rows. This replaced a 60-day window that materialized a `DailyProteinRecord` per
past day (2026-08-12): once history went unbounded, that meant inserting a row
for every day since install on every target change, and any day older than the
window silently inherited the new target. Stored rows still outrank the log —
they are what the day was actually reconciled against.

Access model: **one StoreKit trial**, decided 2026-08-04. The offer sheet is the
final onboarding step and StoreKit owns the 7 days. There is no separate local
trial window — `docs/plan.md` §7 flagged the stacked alternative and it was
rejected.

## App-specific notes
- **Review funnel trigger**: the third distinct day the user hits their target
  (`ReviewPromptTracker.recordTargetHit`), never before. App Store ID 6797089333.
- **App Review 1.4.1**: the lifter / GLP-1 / post-bariatric stories stay "track
  the target you were given". Never "we set your medical target". Two unit tests
  (`testReasonCopyMakesNoMedicalClaims`, `testCombinedRationaleMakesNoMedicalClaims`)
  fail the build on treat/cure/diagnose/prescribe/prevent appearing in the
  audience copy, the second across all 16 reason combinations — keep it that way.
- **Reasons are multi-select** (2026-08-10). They stack in real life: a lifter on
  a GLP-1 is one person with one target. Any medical reason in the set means the
  number is entered, never inferred; otherwise the most demanding reason sets the
  suggestion. Stored as `reasons` (array of raw values), migrated from the old
  single `reason` key on first launch.
- **Positioning is anti-AI on purpose.** No photo estimation, no food database,
  no calories, no macros beyond protein. That is the product, not a backlog.
- Never put `calorie`, `macro`, `AI`, or `scanner` in the subtitle — those steer
  Apple toward difficulty 73-81 SERPs and contradict the position (`aso-plan.md` §5).
- The subtitle is **not** where the Watch story goes. Every watch term measured
  at Astro's floor (`protein watch` 5, `protein widget` 5, `apple watch food` 5
  at difficulty 72), fleet-wide, so a Watch-first subtitle spends 30 characters
  on zero demand; and `Apple Watch` is an Apple trademark that metadata rules
  keep out of the name and subtitle. The shipped `on Watch` says it safely.
  `glp1` stays out of the keyword field for the same floor-demand reason.
  Shipped name/subtitle/keywords and the full rationale: `aso-plan.md` §7.
- **The subtitle's job is the `track` token** (changed 2026-08-16, all 50
  locales). `Daily intake goal, on Watch` became `Track daily intake on Watch`,
  same 27 characters. Nothing in the metadata carried the bare `track`, only
  `Tracker` in the name, so `track protein` (19/46), the realistic near-term
  rank, and the only above-floor protein term besides the guarded head, was
  plausibly unindexed. `goal` was floor and `target` covers it from the keyword
  field. Do not spend the subtitle on floor-demand nouns again.
- **The keyword field is full and should stay as it is.** Every above-floor,
  intent-passing term is covered; `whey protein` measured 9/11 in 2026-08-16 and
  justifies `whey`. `bodybuilding` (24/58) is the one that keeps looking like a
  gap and is not: its SERP is workout apps top to bottom, so it fails the §2
  intent guardrail. The only open question is `healthkit`, 9 characters and never
  measured. Measure before trading anything.
- Watch layout must fit above the fold on a 41mm (224pt) screen. There is no
  navigation title for exactly this reason, and Undo takes the "Other" slot
  rather than adding a fourth row. Two more rules, both learned by rendering it
  (2026-08-13): **the ring holds the number and nothing else** (a circle's
  usable width collapses either side of its centre, so a caption stacked under
  the number sits where there is least room and runs into the stroke), and
  **the ring's ZStack is explicitly square**. A `Circle` stays 88pt on any
  watch, but a text stack sharing that ZStack takes the full screen width, so
  a caption that fits a 42mm overhangs the arc on a 46mm. The words go under
  the ring, on one line, where the screen is rectangular.
  `ProteinFormat.compactTargetCaption` is the wrist-sized `targetCaption`.
- The pool has no 41/42mm watch (`agent-sim checkout --watch` hands out a 46mm
  Series 11 or a 44mm SE). Verifying the fold means creating a throwaway
  `Apple-Watch-Series-11-42mm` device, screenshotting it headlessly, and
  deleting it. Do that for any change to the watch's vertical rhythm.
- **The complication and widget glyph is the app's own mark, a `g`**, not
  `bolt.fill` (changed 2026-08-13). The app icon is a lowercase g in a progress
  ring, so the bolt matched nothing; worse, watchOS spends `bolt.fill` on
  charging, so it read as a battery indicator on the one surface that sits
  beside real system glyphs. In a gauge the label is `Text("g")` under the
  value, which also just reads as the unit ("124 g"); the inline family needs a
  symbol, so it uses `g.circle.fill` (watchOS 6+). The bolt stays inside the
  app, where it decorates quick-add and Protein+ rather than identifying it.
- `ScreenshotFixtures` (DEBUG) backs `-SeedScreenshotData` / `-ScreenshotTab N`
  / `-PaywallSnapshot`. `StoreService` hydrates the paywall on the simulator from
  StoreKit Testing, falling back to `TestStoreProduct` fixtures, so the real
  paywall renders headlessly without ever configuring the prod RevenueCat key.

## Release state (2026-08-16)

The release audit is green (101 unit tests, all four targets). Release archive
build 20 is uploaded, VALID, attached to 1.0, and submitted for review. Build 19
was the first carrying the app's own privacy manifests.
`scripts/asc-readiness.py` reports the live state of everything below; run it
rather than trusting this list.

**Done:** (`asc-readiness.py` run 2026-08-16: **no gaps**, 5 iPhone and 5 Apple Watch screenshots, all three URLs 200)

- TestFlight build 20 is uploaded, VALID, and **attached** to the 1.0 version.
  A draft version keeps the build that was attached first, so this needs
  re-pointing after every upload: build 8 stayed attached for two days after
  logging went free, which left the description promising a free tap that the
  attached binary charged for. `asc-readiness.py` fails when the attached build
  is not the newest VALID one, so the drift shows up before a submission, and
  **`scripts/asc-attach-build.py` fixes it** — it waits out processing and
  re-points the draft version. Run it after every `testflight.sh`.
- ASC products are all in review (`WAITING_FOR_REVIEW`, `READY_TO_SUBMIT`
  before the submit): `.monthly` $5.99, `.yearly` $29.99
  (both with a 1-week free trial in 175 territories and the Vitals PPP
  overrides), `.pro.lifetime` $59.99. Repriced up from $1.99 / $14.99 / $29.99
  effective 2026-08-10, the day logging went free: the old rows are preserved
  for anyone already subscribed. Nothing in the app hardcodes a price, but the
  App Store description, `docs/index.html`, `Protein.storekit`, and
  `StoreService.fixtureProducts()` all restate them, and all four were stale
  until 2026-08-11. Check them against ASC after any price change.
- The ASC record is renamed **Protein Tracker - Grams Today** (subtitle "Track
  daily intake on Watch"), genre Health & Fitness, with description, keywords,
  promo text, all three URLs, 5 iPhone 6.9" screenshots and 5 Apple Watch Series 10 screenshots, App Store review notes,
  and the age-rating declaration (`healthOrWellnessTopics` true,
  `medicalOrTreatmentInformation` NONE — mirroring Total Calories).

- The repo is public at **github.com/jackwallner/protein** with Pages serving
  `main` `/docs`. The privacy, terms, and support URLs in the metadata all
  resolve 200.

**RevenueCat is wired (2026-08-05).** The `default` offering now returns all
three packages from the public SDK endpoint the app calls, so a device build
renders the paywall instead of "Protein+ Plans Unavailable".

The failure was never the App Store side. All three IAPs have been
READY_TO_SUBMIT throughout. The project had two apps, `Protein (App Store)` and
a `Test Store`, and every package was attached to a Test Store product with a
bare identifier (`monthly`, `yearly`, `lifetime`). There were **zero App Store
products** in the project. Asked with `X-Platform: ios`, RevenueCat filtered to
App Store products, found none in any package, and dropped all three, an empty
offering that looked like missing packages. The ASC API key being configured
does *not* import a catalogue; it resolves metadata for products you declare.

`scripts/rc-setup.py` created the three App Store products, attached them to the
`Protein+` entitlement, and attached each to its existing package. The Test
Store products stay attached alongside, which is what keeps paywall previews
working; iOS filters them out.

Two things worth knowing next time:

- **V2 secret keys are project-scoped.** Every other key on this machine (VO2
  Max, Bridge, Cribbage, Mahj, StatScout, Aging, Queasy, DreamCart) returns only
  its own project from `GET /v2/projects`. A new app needs a key minted in its
  own project: Dashboard → project → Project settings → API keys → **+ New** →
  Secret key, `project_configuration` read/write.
- The lifetime product lands as `non_renewing_subscription` rather than
  `non_consumable`, because that is what v2's `type: "one_time"` maps to. VO2
  Max and Bridge both look identical, so it is fleet-wide rather than a Protein
  bug, but it has never been confirmed against a real lifetime purchase.

The App Review notes were rewritten 2026-08-11 and amended 2026-08-12. They said
"PROTEIN+ ... unlocks logging" a day after the description started saying logging
is free, a contradiction sitting in the two documents a reviewer reads side by
side, and then said "thirty days of history" after history went unbounded. They
now lead with "logging is free, no reviewer action is needed to exercise the
core feature". Those notes live only in ASC, not in `fastlane/metadata`, so
nothing in the repo reminds you they went stale: re-read them after any change
to what is paid. There is no script; patch `/appStoreReviewDetails/{id}` with
`asc_lib` directly.

## Submitted for review (2026-08-16)

Review submission `58cc9187…` went in at 04:45 UTC on 2026-08-17 with five
items, all `WAITING_FOR_REVIEW`: version 1.0 with **build 20** attached, both
subscriptions, and the lifetime IAP. `scripts/asc-submit-for-review.py` does the
last two steps (add the version as a `reviewSubmissionItem`, then
`PATCH {"submitted": true}`); the products were queued by hand beforehand,
because the v1 endpoint this key can see still has no relationship for them.

Two things blocked the submit that nothing in the repo predicted:

- **`contentRightsDeclaration` on the app was `null`**, and Apple refuses to
  create the *version* item without it: 409
  `ENTITY_ERROR.ATTRIBUTE.REQUIRED`. It was recorded here as answered in the web
  UI on 2026-08-15, so the note was wrong, not the API. Set from a script:
  `PATCH /apps/{id}` with `DOES_NOT_USE_THIRD_PARTY_CONTENT`, which is the true
  answer for an app with no food database, no photos, and no licensed data.
  Unlike the other forms below, this one **is** readable, so check it rather
  than trusting a note.
- **The type digit in a review submission item's id means nothing you can rely
  on.** Items come back with every relationship empty for this key, and the ids
  decode to `<submission>|<type>|<uuid>`. A first pass read type 17 as the
  version, skipped the add, and the submit failed on a missing
  `appStoreVersionForReview`. The script now always attempts the add and treats
  a duplicate as success.

**Still outstanding, needing Jack:** a real purchase has never been made on a
device. The offering resolves, which is necessary and not sufficient;
sandbox-buy each of the three and confirm `Protein+` goes active. This did not
block submission, but it is the one part of the funnel nothing here has proven.

The App Privacy questionnaire, the DSA trader declaration, the Regulated Medical
Device answer (No), and the Paid Apps/tax/banking agreements were all completed
in the web UI on 2026-08-15. None of them is visible to `asc-readiness.py`; the
API cannot read any of those forms.

## Privacy manifests, and the analytics answer (2026-08-15)

**All four executables ship their own `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`.** Apple wants the
manifest in every binary that touches a required-reason API, not just the app,
and up to build 18 the archive carried only RevenueCat's. The only such API here
is `UserDefaults`: `CA92.1` for the app's own defaults and `1C8F.1` for the App
Group ones, which is what the widgets and the watch actually read, so both
reasons are declared in all four. Tracking is false, tracking domains and
collected data types are empty.

XcodeGen needs the file **excluded from the target's source path and re-added
with `buildPhase: resources`** (the fleet shape, see SimpleGLP). A manifest that
is only swept up by `- path: Protein` does not reliably land in the bundle, and
an archive that silently lacks it looks identical to one that has it.

**RevenueCat paywall impressions stay** (decided 2026-08-15). `StoreService.trackPaywallImpression`
reports three IDs — `protein_paywall`, `protein_plus_tab`, `protein_onboarding_trial`
— and the other fifteen apps in the fleet do the same, which is where the
impression and conversion numbers in the RC dashboard come from. The "no ads, no
analytics" line in the app, the site, and the description stays as written. The
residual: those calls are product-interaction events sent to a third party, so a
strict reading of Apple's App Privacy form wants Usage Data › Product
Interaction declared alongside Purchases. It is not declared. Revisit that
answer, not the code, if App Review ever asks.

## Protein+, never "Protein Plus", anywhere a customer can read it (2026-08-15)

The App Store product names said **Protein Plus** in 49 of 50 locales: the group
name, `Protein Plus Monthly`, `Protein Plus Yearly`, `Protein Plus Lifetime`.
Only en-US was branded, because `fastlane/metadata/en-US/products.json` is the
only localized products file and both setup scripts fell back to the ASC
*reference* name for every locale without one. Those names are what the purchase
sheet and Settings › Apple ID › Subscriptions show, so a German buyer saw a
different product than the app, the paywall, the website, and the description.

`scripts/asc-rename-plus-branding.py` fixed all 196 localizations and is
idempotent; the two setup scripts now fall back to `GROUP_DISPLAY_NAME` /
`PRODUCT_DISPLAY_NAME` instead of the reference name. **Reference names stay
spelled out** — they are immutable after creation and ASC-internal.

The rename needed the products **out of the staged review submission first**.
Every localization of a queued product is frozen: ASC answers 409
`ENTITY_ERROR.ATTRIBUTE.INVALID.UNMODIFIABLE` on the name *and* on the
description, while the app version next to it stays fully editable. Deleting the
`reviewSubmissionItems` unfreezes them and leaves the version, its attached
build, and the products' `READY_TO_SUBMIT` state untouched. Do product metadata
before queueing, not after.

## The listing speaks 50 languages; the app speaks one (2026-08-16)

Protein shipped its first metadata in en-US only, and was the only app in the
fleet doing so: VO2 Max, Simple GLP, and Sober all carry 50 translated
`appStoreVersionLocalizations` and 50 `appInfoLocalizations`. Forty-nine empty
keyword fields, at 100 characters each, is the part that costs something, in an
app where `aso-plan.md` already calls keyword volume the binding constraint.

`fastlane/metadata/<locale>/` now holds name, subtitle, keywords, description,
promo text, and release notes for all 50, pushed by
**`scripts/asc-upload-localizations.py`**. Two things that script does on
purpose:

- **It never touches `appScreenshotSets`.** Screenshots live on en-US and every
  other storefront falls back to them, which is the fleet shape (VO2 Max has
  sets on 1 of its 50). Running fastlane deliver instead would walk the
  screenshot tree and has double-uploaded a set on retry.
- **It re-reads before creating a version localization.** Adding a language to
  the app info *also* creates that locale's version localization, so a create
  built from a map read seconds earlier answers 409
  `ENTITY_ERROR.ATTRIBUTE.INVALID.DUPLICATE`.

Product names and descriptions stay English in all 50 (`Protein+ Monthly`,
"Monthly access to Protein+."), matching VO2+ and the rest of the fleet.

`asc-readiness.py` had to change with it. It now folds the per-localization
checks into one row per field instead of printing 50 near-identical lines, and
the subscription-disclosure check only looks for the four English phrases in
`en-*`. Apple wants those terms in each storefront's own language, so elsewhere
it asserts what survives translation: `24`, the EULA link, and the privacy link.

**The app itself is still English-only** and is not one string file away from
being otherwise. `knownRegions` is `(Base, en)`, and every number-bearing string
is built by interpolation in `ProteinFormat` and returned as `String`, so
`Text(_:)` never sees a `LocalizedStringKey` — the hero lines on the phone, the
watch, both widgets, and all four complications are invisible to a String
Catalog until they are restructured. Dates, percentages, and the preset list do
go through Foundation formatters and are already locale-correct. The one real
bug underneath this, onboarding printing a body weight in kg to everyone
including the US, went away with the change below.

## Body weight is typed, not read from Health (2026-08-16)

"Suggest from my body weight" on the onboarding target step opens a field and an
lb/kg picker (`BodyWeightUnit.localeDefault`, pounds in the US and UK) rather
than reading `HKQuantityType(.bodyMass)`. The weight is converted and
range-checked by `ProteinTargets.bodyWeightKilograms(fromText:unit:)`, which
answers nil outside 25–300 kg so a typo suggests nothing rather than something
absurd.

What the Health read cost, all of it for one multiplication: a **second
permission sheet** mid-onboarding, before the app could answer at all; the
number printed in **kg to everyone** because the sample is stored in kg; and
nothing to say to the many people whose weight is not in Health, on a brand new
phone least of all. `requestBodyMassAuthorization` and `fetchBodyMassKilograms`
are gone from `HealthKitService`, the body-weight sentence is out of
`NSHealthShareUsageDescription`, and the privacy policy now says the app reads
no body weight. HealthKit access is dietary protein, read and write, and nothing
else.

## The hero is grams tracked, not grams left (2026-08-13)

Every surface leads with the grams logged so far today, counting up, with the
target as the caption under it: `124` / `grams tracked` / `of 160 g target`.
It replaced a countdown (`36` / `grams left`) on the phone hero, the watch
hero, both widget families, all four complication families, the evening
reminder, and the App Store name and copy.

A countdown has two problems the total does not. It has to clamp at zero, so
`ProteinFormat` needed a signed-overage variant for every slot too small for a
caption, and 160 of 160 read exactly like 185 of 160 anywhere that clamp
showed. And it describes the day as a deficit right up until the last bite,
which is the wrong frame for an app whose whole premise is that you logged.

`ProteinReconciliation.remaining` still exists and is still tested (it is the
arithmetic behind "of 160 g target"), but nothing renders it any more. The
formatter entry points are `trackedHeadline`, `compactTracked`,
`targetCaption`, and `gaugeValue`/`gaugeGrams`, and the last two dropped their
`target:` argument, because a total needs no target to stay honest.

## Rejected 4.3, resubmitted 2026-09-01

Build 20 was rejected under **guideline 4.3 (spam)**: "similar binary, metadata,
and/or concept as apps submitted by other developers, with only minor
differences." Nothing in the binary changed for the resubmission. Four things
were wrong around it, and all four are fixed.

**The repo did not exist.** `~/protein` was renamed to `~/caffeine` in
`bed4b25` ("pivot protein tracker to caffeine planner"), which left this app
with a rejected 1.0 and no working tree. Restored from `cc976b4`, the commit
before the pivot, and pushed to github.com/jackwallner/protein.

**All three URLs 404'd**, which is an automatic 5.1.1 rejection on its own and
would have wasted the resubmission. Deleting the repo took the Pages site with
it. Pages is re-enabled on `main` `/docs`; privacy, support, marketing, and
terms all return 200. `asc-readiness.py` checks these, so run it before every
submit: it is the one gap the API cannot infer from the version record.

**Every product was available in zero territories.** The two subscriptions and
the lifetime IAP each read "0 of 175 countries or regions selected", the IAP
with **Remove from Sale** actively set, while all of them still reported
`READY_TO_SUBMIT` and `asc-readiness.py` reported no gaps. Prices were intact
(monthly $5.99, yearly $29.99, lifetime $59.99, with the PPP overrides), only
availability was wiped, most likely when the products were unstuck from the
August submission. A device build would have rendered a paywall with nothing
purchasable. **Availability is not visible to this API key** (`/v1/inAppPurchases/{id}/inAppPurchaseAvailability`
and `/v1/subscriptions/{id}/availableTerritories` both 404), so nothing in the
repo can catch this. Check it by eye in ASC after any product surgery.

**A subscription group is not a submittable item by itself.** Adding the group
left the submit button dead with "New subscription groups must be submitted
with an auto-renewable subscription from within that group". Each subscription
has to be added individually from its own page, so the submission carries five
items: the version, the group, both subscriptions, and the lifetime IAP.

The App Review notes now open with a **4.3 section** naming what is particular
to this app and where a reviewer sees it in under a minute (the Sources screen's
per-app HealthKit attribution, HealthKit as the store rather than a mirror,
target history, and the deliberate absence of a food database), and ask Apple to
name the app it was matched against. Notes cap at 4000 characters; the current
set is 3096. They live only in ASC, so re-read them after any change to what is
paid.

Submission `87df25c6` went in at 21:54 UTC on 2026-09-01, five items,
`WAITING_FOR_REVIEW`, build 20, manual release.

**RevenueCat moved to its own project.** `proj2da5e398` was renamed *Caffeine*
during the pivot and still holds both apps' products. Protein now points at
`proj6681ebb5` with public key `appl_afIOVjPptziekOgZJRrBVzuddka`;
`rc-setup.py` created the three products, the `Protein+` entitlement, and the
`default` offering with all three packages, verified through the public
offerings endpoint the app actually calls. The v2 API now **rejects
`is_current` on offering creation**, so marking the offering current is a
separate step.

## Open risks (carried from `docs/plan.md` §8)
1. **The HealthKit import test has never been run on a real device.** Whether
   MacroFactor / Cronometer / MyFitnessPal actually write readable
   `dietaryProtein` is unverified. If they mostly do not, the Sources screen
   degrades to a near-empty list and the import claim has to come off the
   product page before submission.
2. Keyword volume is the binding constraint, not the build (`aso-plan.md`).
3. PROTEIN PAL is a registered mark. Only a Justia search was run, never a real
   USPTO clearance.

review funnel, gotchas): always-loaded global CLAUDE.md + the `ios-dev` skill.
