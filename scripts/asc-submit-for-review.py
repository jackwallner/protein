"""Add the draft version to the staged review submission and submit it.

The last step of a release, and the one nothing else in this repo does. It is
deliberately two operations in one script because they only make sense
together: a review submission with no items submits nothing, and an item added
to a submission that is never submitted just freezes the metadata it points at
(see AGENTS.md, "ASC submission freezes IAP metadata").

Products (subscriptions and one-time IAPs) cannot be added here. The v1
`reviewSubmissionItems` endpoint this API key can see has no relationship for
them, so they are queued by hand in Monetization > Add for Review. This script
reports how many items the submission already carries so a missing product is
visible before the submit rather than after the review.

    scripts/asc-submit-for-review.py --dry-run   # report, change nothing
    scripts/asc-submit-for-review.py             # add the version, submit
